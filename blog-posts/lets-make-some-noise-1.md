Noise is an amazing thing. Not only is it the sounds we make while moving through life. Screams, laughter, yelling out the window at a stranger because your code won't compile and you swear to God that you did not change one line since the last time. You know, the bad and not-so-bad times. In this mini-series I suppose I will write about noise but not that kind of noise; we will discover mathematical noise.

## Noise - definitions and contradictions
While the internet is always correct it is most definitly not correct when it comes to defining the term 'noise'. There are definitions that are of the same scientific quality as an artists illustration of a black hole. They are colorfull, symmetric, vague, wrong and just really hard to grasp. Therefore I will try to explain noise from a couple of different non-conflicting perspectives.

Noise is more or less a series of values and sometimes theses sequences can have some distinct properties. When classifying noise we usually end of giving them a color distinction such as; white noise, pink noise and brown noise. The last type of noise is not really namned after a color but after a man called Mr. Brown and funnily enough he is namned after a color.
