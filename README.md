# Procedural-Noise
Assortment of noise functions, mainly used in other projects.

# Goals
* Provide a standard cross-platform implementation a bunch of noise functions together with references to the sources/authors.
* Correct implementation rather than speed.
* Readable code rather than speed.
* Variants of different algorithms in order to promote comparisons between algorithms and different implementation techniques
